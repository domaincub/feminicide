            <h2>What is Femicide?</h2>
            <p>Femicide refers to the intentional killing of women and girls solely because of their gender. It is a severe and extreme form of gender-based violence, often rooted in deeply ingrained societal norms and misogyny. Femicide can occur in various contexts, including domestic violence, honor killings, dowry-related murders, and targeted killings during armed conflicts.

                This heinous act is not just a crime against individuals but a violation of human rights, reflecting systemic discrimination and inequality. Addressing femicide requires comprehensive efforts to challenge and change the cultural, social, and legal structures that perpetuate violence against women. It involves raising awareness, implementing strict laws, providing support to survivors, and promoting gender equality to create a safer and more just society for all.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Femicide</h2>
            <p>The impact of femicide reaches far beyond the immediate tragedy of the loss of life, deeply affecting families, communities, and societies on multiple levels. Families and friends of femicide victims experience profound emotional and psychological trauma that can have long-lasting effects.</p>
            <ul class="impact-list">
                <li><strong>Emotional Trauma:</strong> Families and friends suffer from grief, anxiety, and depression.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Disruption:</strong> Communities lose trust and cohesion, leading to increased fear and insecurity.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Burden:</strong> Loss of productivity and increased healthcare costs strain economies.</li>
                <li><strong>Generational Impact:</strong> Children who witness or experience violence are more likely to perpetuate cycles of abuse.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Harm:</strong> Gender-based violence reinforces harmful stereotypes and inequalities.</li>
